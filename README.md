# Convolutional Neural Network Modelling for Polysomnography Data of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Diagnosis



## Introduction
- This is a master thesis during my Master study in Wilfrid Laurier University (2018-2019)
  * Thesis Supervisor: [**Dr. Xu (Sunny) Wang**](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/xu-sunny-wang/index.html?ref=faculty-profiles%2Fscience%2Fxu-sunny-wang.html)
  * Examining Committee: [**Dr. Roman Makarov**](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/roman-makarov/index.html) [**Dr. Yang Liu**](https://online.wlu.ca/faculty/yang-liu)

- The main goal of this project is to investigate how effective a CNN model could be used to classify high dimensional polysomnography signals. Based on the application on Polysomnography (PSG) data, I will find:

    * 1. The proper CNN architectures for the PSG data.
    * 2. The optimized hyperparameters for the performance of CNN models.
    * 3. The performance visualization for the prediction of different OSA severity levels, i.e, different obstructive sleep apnea levels.

- Ultimately, the chosen CNN models can be used as a screening tool for those suspected to suffer from OSA.
